‚úÖ Q1: How Edge AI reduces latency and enhances privacy. Real-world example included.
Answer:

Edge AI refers to deploying AI algorithms directly on local devices (e.g., smartphones, sensors, drones) instead of relying on a centralized cloud server for inference and decision-making.

‚ö° Latency Reduction:
Cloud AI introduces delay due to data transmission and server response time.

Edge AI eliminates this by processing data locally, enabling near real-time decisions.

Real-world example:
Autonomous drones equipped with edge AI can process visual and sensor data on-board to avoid obstacles instantly, even in remote areas without internet access.

üîê Privacy Enhancement:
Cloud AI sends user data (e.g., video, audio, location) to servers‚Äîraising privacy concerns.

Edge AI keeps data on the device, reducing the risk of interception, data breaches, or third-party misuse.

Real-world example:
Smart doorbells or surveillance systems (e.g., Google Nest Cam) use edge AI to detect motion or faces on-device, avoiding continuous cloud uploads.

Feature	Cloud AI	Edge AI
Latency	High (due to transmission)	Low (on-device computation)
Privacy	Risk of data leaks	Data remains local
Internet Need	Always connected	Can work offline
Use Case	Batch inference	Real-time reaction (drones, wearables)
