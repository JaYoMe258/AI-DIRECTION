🏙️ Case Study: AI in Smart Cities — Traffic Management with IoT Integration
🔍 Analysis: How does integrating AI with IoT improve urban sustainability?
AI-IoT synergy forms the backbone of modern smart cities, enabling real-time traffic optimization, reduced emissions, and efficient energy use.

🌐 How It Works:
IoT Sensors (e.g., cameras, GPS, inductive loops) collect data on traffic flow, congestion, pedestrian activity, and vehicle types.

AI algorithms analyze patterns, predict traffic surges, and dynamically control traffic signals, rerouting vehicles in real time.

🛣️ Example:
In Barcelona, AI-driven systems adapt traffic light timing based on congestion data, reducing travel times and CO₂ output — improving both mobility and environmental health.

🌱 Urban Sustainability Benefits
Reduced Emissions: Optimized traffic flow cuts idling time, lowering greenhouse gas output.

Energy Efficiency: Smart streetlights powered by AI dim when no motion is detected, conserving power.

Public Transit Efficiency: AI predicts demand surges, reallocates buses, and improves schedules.

⚠️ Challenges in Implementation
1. 🔐 Data Security & Privacy
IoT devices gather real-time data on vehicles and people. Without encryption and secure protocols, this data could be intercepted or misused.

Example: License plate recognition cameras must ensure images aren't shared without legal oversight.

2. 🔧 Infrastructure & Interoperability
Legacy systems often cannot communicate with modern IoT devices. Upgrading infrastructure across city departments requires huge investment and cross-vendor integration.
